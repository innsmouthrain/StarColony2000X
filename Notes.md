# Possible changes

- ### Question mark: Could the amount chosen for mining be hidden information? And also the movement marker?
- ### They could be set on the ship board on pre-written boxes
- ### Then the split between the split miners could be calculated differently
- ### Generally would allow for more deceit/co-operation moments
- ### It would have to be against the rules to show eachother your boards
-
- ### Sending crystals to mines - this would need a lot of rebalancing since it could be op but could be a cool countermeasure to griefers
- ### The WINNER should receive 3 crystals as a reward but only if the police has been paid this turn
