Other mechanics
----

- Resources
    - Power crystals - the main resource
    - Intergalactic Dollars $$$ - needed for gvt interaction
    - Contracts and deals - up to player imagination
- Mines and mining
    - Mines regenerate faster the more crystals they have
    - Depleted mines can not regenerate
    - Mining the same mine incurs an efficiency penalty
- Robot Space Lord Council
    - Will buy crystals for $$$
    - Will fire laser for laser tax, collected throughout round
    - Laser tax is the laser cost + 1, rounded up to nearest $
    - Awards the winning player with the *WINNER* medal
- Laser
    - Can be fired by Robot Space Lord Council
    - Can be fired by a player's single donation of 7+ crystals depending on alien strength
- Alien
    - The alien instantly kills any ship with 0 crystals at end of round
    - If laser is not fired, the alien will instantly kill the player with the least crystals at end of round
    - With every kill, the alien grows stronger, requiring a +1 laser cost to be kept at bay
- Police
    - For a mere $3, the Police will take all but 1 crystals from the player with the most crystals and distribute them evenly (or randomly) across the rest
